## [Example simulation](example_simulations/README.md)
Simulation input files, and auxiliary files, have been added in the [example_simulations folder](https://github.com/DIDSR/VICTRE_MCGPU/tree/master/example_simulations) to allow the replication of two of the simulations of the VICTRE project.
A breast phantom with scattered glandularity and a heterogreously dense phantom created with C. Graff model are provided (these phantoms were not part of the original VICTRE pivotal study, and have a single large mass embedded inside). The material files (generated from PENELOPE 2006 material files) and energy spectra used in the simulations are included.
